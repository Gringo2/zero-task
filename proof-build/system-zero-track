- Regenerated social preview image with correct branding.
- Updated alt text across App.tsx and README.md for brand consistency.
RESULTS:
All CI/CD checks passing. GitHub deployment successful with correct branding.
EXPLANATION:
This milestone demonstrates the final refinement loop of System Zero: detecting errors through automated verification (CI/CD), correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring all artifacts align with the project's true identity. The fact that the branding error was caught and fixed through the automated pipeline validates the robustness of our testing infrastructure.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-11-theme-engine
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: f6e79fd
DESCRIPTION: Visual accessibility and layout containment.
CHANGES:
- Implemented Light/Dark theme engine with useTheme hook.
- Created ThemeToggle UI component with persistence.
- Restructured CSS tokens.css for dynamic theme switching.
- Fixed horizontal body overflow by optimizing width constraints (100vw -> 100%).
RESULTS:
Application now supports user-selectable themes with full state persistence. Layout is perfectly responsive without overflow artifacts.
EXPLANATION:
Themes and smooth layout containment are essential for high-fidelity interactive systems. By moving theme logic into a dedicated hook and CSS variable system, we maintain clean separation of concerns while enhancing the user experience.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-12-docs-sync
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 376d5cc
DESCRIPTION: Documentation synchronization.
CHANGES:
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with Theme Engine and Search bar component diagrams.
- Updated DESIGN.md with useTheme hook state patterns and token restructuring.
- Updated SRS.md to Version 1.1, adding Theme Switching functional requirements.
- Updated docs/README.md with status table and branding consistency.
RESULTS:
Project documentation is now a 1:1 reflection of the current production implementation.
EXPLANATION:
In System Zero, documentation is as vital as code. Ensuring that ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN, and SRS artifacts are synchronized with the actual codebase maintains the integrity of the auditable trail and provides a clear technical map for future expansion.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-13-mkdocs-serve
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 37740f9
DESCRIPTION: Professional documentation serving infrastructure.
CHANGES:
- Installed MkDocs and MkDocs-Material via Python/pip.
- Created mkdocs.yml configuration with Material theme and Mermaid diagram support.
- Developed scripts/serve-docs.ps1 with automatic port checking (8000+).
- Added "docs:serve" command to package.json.
RESULTS:
Documentation is now served via a professional, localized web interface with searchable navigation and rendered diagrams.
EXPLANATION:
Serving documentation through a dedicated, feature-rich interface (MkDocs) ensures that technical knowledge is accessible and navigable. The automatic port checking script further enhances the developer experience by preventing common infrastructure conflicts.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-14-mermaid-fix
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 95eca18
DESCRIPTION: Technical refinement for Mermaid diagram stability.
CHANGES:
- Standardized all diagrams to graph TD (Top-Down) for maximum layout reliability.
- Simplified node labels (e.g., TTask[] -> TTask Array) to avoid parser conflicts.
- Ensured 100% quoting of labels containing functional characters (colons, slashes).
- Verified syntax across ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN, and SRS documents.
RESULTS:
Documentation diagrams are now fully renderable in the Material MkDocs theme without raw code artifacts.
EXPLANATION:
MkDocs/Material processing of Mermaid diagrams can be sensitive to specific character combinations like brackets and certain line-break syntax. Moving to a standardized, quoted, and Top-Down approach ensures that the technical maps remain visual and accessible across all documentation pages.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-15-elaborative-docs
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 41e40a2
DESCRIPTION: Elaborative documentation expansion with System Zero manifestos.
CHANGES:
- Added Technical Manifesto to ARCHITECTURE.md explaining the Sovereign SPA concept.
- Added Aesthetic Theory section to DESIGN.md articulating Layered Clarity philosophy.
- Added Requirement Philosophy to SRS.md defining the Sovereign Individual persona.
- Added Conceptual Alignment sections to all business logic documentation.
- Expanded narrative depth across all technical specifications.
RESULTS:
Documentation now serves as both technical reference and philosophical manifesto, communicating the why behind every design decision in the System Zero doctrine.
EXPLANATION:
Documentation should be as expressive as code is precise. By transforming specifications into a manifesto, we create living architecture that onboards contributors not just to the mechanics, but to the mission of digital sovereignty and auditability.
--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-16-immersive-interaction
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 8ec5b08
DESCRIPTION: Immersive Interaction Milestone with Framer Motion integration.
CHANGES:
- Installed framer-motion library.
- Implemented reorderTasks in useTasks hook for persistent state updates.
- Integrated Reorder.Group and AnimatePresence in TaskList.
- Converted TaskItem to Reorder.Item with slide-in/out and micro-animations.
RESULTS:
Application now fulfills the 'Immersive Interaction' specify in DESIGN.md. Tasks animate smoothly on creation, deletion, and filtering. Drag-and-drop reordering is functional and persists locally.
EXPLANATION:
By closing the gap between documentation and reality, we maintain the integrity of the System Zero doctrine. The inclusion of physics-based animations via Framer Motion transforms the UI into a tactile instrument, reinforcing the reactive nature of the system.
--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-17-sovereignty-audit
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: f03a52a
DESCRIPTION: Sovereignty & Audit Milestone implementing data portability and mutation logging.
CHANGES:
- Created useAudit hook with localStorage persistence for action tracking.
- Enhanced useTasks hook with onAction callback, importTasks, and clearTasks.
- Created SystemControls component with high-fidelity glassmorphism UI.
- Implemented JSON export/import and 'Nuke' data operations.
RESULTS:
Users now have total control over their data lifecycle and a high-integrity trail of system actions. Auditability is now a visible technical reality.
EXPLANATION:
The introduction of the System Control Engine moves ZERO-TASK from a simple utility to a true 'Sovereign Instrument'. By providing export/import tools, we ensure the user is not locked into the system, and the audit log provides proof of state history.
