EXPLANATION:
This milestone demonstrates the final refinement loop of System Zero: detecting errors through automated verification (CI/CD), correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring all artifacts align with the project's true identity. The fact that the branding error was caught and fixed through the automated pipeline validates the robustness of our testing infrastructure.
