[TRACKING LOG]

ID: task-1-pilot
STATUS: COMPLETED
DESCRIPTION: Initial functional prototype.
FEATURES:
- In-memory state management (Ephemeral)
- Glassmorphism UI
- Basic CRUD operations
NOTE: Data lost on reload.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-2-alpha-persistence
STATUS: COMPLETED
COMMIT: 91c07ca
DESCRIPTION: Implementation of data persistence.
CHANGES:
- Upgraded useTasks hook to implement localStorage.
- Auto-hydration on load.
- Auto-save on state change.
EXPLANATION:
Storage logic was added to bridge the gap between sessions. We chose localStorage for simplicity as it fits the "System Zero" requirement for client-side containment without needing a backend yet.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-3-assurance-testing
STATUS: COMPLETED
COMMIT: 1e85c9e
DESCRIPTION: Test infrastructure and verification.
CHANGES:
- Installed Vitest + React Testing Library + JSDOM.
- Created vitest.config.ts and test setup.
- Wrote 6 unit tests for useTasks hook.
- Wrote 4 component tests for TaskForm.
RESULTS:
All 10 tests passed.
EXPLANATION:
Following System Zero doctrine (auditability), we established automated testing to ensure code correctness. Tests cover CRUD operations, persistence logic, form validation, and UI interaction.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-4-beta-features
STATUS: COMPLETED
COMMIT: 9dc6e0b
DESCRIPTION: Task filtering and editing features.
CHANGES:
- Created FilterBar component (All/Active/Completed).
- Added updateTask to useTasks hook.
- Implemented inline editing mode in TaskItem.
RESULTS:
All 14 tests passed (7 useTasks + 4 TaskForm + 3 FilterBar).

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-5-search
STATUS: COMPLETED
COMMIT: e4006c0
DESCRIPTION: Live task search functionality.
CHANGES:
- Created SearchBar component with clear functionality.
- Integrated search state in App.tsx.
- Implemented case-insensitive search filtering in TaskList.
- Added 5 unit tests for SearchBar.
RESULTS:
All 19 tests passed total.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-6-production
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 5594f58
DESCRIPTION: Production-ready containment and auditability.
CHANGES:
- Created Dockerfile (multi-stage) and docker-compose.yml.
- Established GitHub Actions CI/CD (verify.yml) for automated tests and linting.
- Updated README.md with comprehensive architecture and deployment guide.
RESULTS:
Project transformed into a self-contained, auditable production artifact.
EXPLANATION:
The final step in System Zero engineering is containment. By providing a Dockerized environment and automated verification workflows, we ensure the project remains immutable, sovereign, and verifiable across different environments.
