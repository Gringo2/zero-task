ID: task-2-alpha-persistence
STATUS: COMPLETED
COMMIT: 91c07ca
DESCRIPTION: Implementation of data persistence.
CHANGES:
- Upgraded useTasks hook to implement localStorage.
- Auto-hydration on load.
- Auto-save on state change.
EXPLANATION:
Storage logic was added to bridge the gap between sessions. We chose localStorage for simplicity as it fits the "System Zero" requirement for client-side containment without needing a backend yet.

STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 9dc6e0b
DESCRIPTION: Task filtering and editing features.
CHANGES:

EXPLANATION:
To achieve Beta status, we added essential UX features: filtering allows users to focus on specific task states, and inline editing enables quick modifications without navigating to separate edit views. All features are fully tested and verified.
