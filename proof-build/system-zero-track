ID: task-9-visual-identity
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: a896efb
DESCRIPTION: Professional visual brand identity.
CHANGES:
- Created hand-coded SVG master logo and favicon.
- Generated high-fidelity social preview (OG Image).
- Updated App.tsx and index.html with new branded assets.
- Integrated styled SVG logo into the application header.
RESULTS:
A cohesive, professional brand identity that elevates the "System Zero" vision.
EXPLANATION:
Visual identity is the final layer of the "System Zero" foundation. By creating a high-fidelity SVG logo and automated asset integration, we move the project from a "prototype" feel to a "professional tool" status, while maintaining perfect auditability and containment.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-10-branding-correction
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: b49c355
DESCRIPTION: Branding correction and quality assurance.
CHANGES:
- Fixed unused FilterType import in FilterBar.test.tsx (CI lint error).
- Updated logo.svg text from "SYSTEM ZERO" to "ZERO TASK".
- Regenerated social preview image with correct branding.
- Updated alt text across App.tsx and README.md for brand consistency.
RESULTS:
All CI/CD checks passing. GitHub deployment successful with correct branding.
EXPLANATION:
This milestone demonstrates the final refinement loop of System Zero: detecting errors through automated verification (CI/CD), correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring all artifacts align with the project's true identity. The fact that the branding error was caught and fixed through the automated pipeline validates the robustness of our testing infrastructure.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-11-theme-engine
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: f6e79fd
DESCRIPTION: Visual accessibility and layout containment.
CHANGES:
- Implemented Light/Dark theme engine with useTheme hook.
- Created ThemeToggle UI component with persistence.
- Restructured CSS tokens.css for dynamic theme switching.
- Fixed horizontal body overflow by optimizing width constraints (100vw -> 100%).
RESULTS:
Application now supports user-selectable themes with full state persistence. Layout is perfectly responsive without overflow artifacts.
EXPLANATION:
Themes and smooth layout containment are essential for high-fidelity interactive systems. By moving theme logic into a dedicated hook and CSS variable system, we maintain clean separation of concerns while enhancing the user experience.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-12-docs-sync
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 376d5cc
DESCRIPTION: Documentation synchronization.
CHANGES:
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with Theme Engine and Search bar component diagrams.
- Updated DESIGN.md with useTheme hook state patterns and token restructuring.
- Updated SRS.md to Version 1.1, adding Theme Switching functional requirements.
- Updated docs/README.md with status table and branding consistency.
RESULTS:
Project documentation is now a 1:1 reflection of the current production implementation.
EXPLANATION:
In System Zero, documentation is as vital as code. Ensuring that ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN, and SRS artifacts are synchronized with the actual codebase maintains the integrity of the auditable trail and provides a clear technical map for future expansion.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-13-mkdocs-serve
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 37740f9
DESCRIPTION: Professional documentation serving infrastructure.
CHANGES:
- Installed MkDocs and MkDocs-Material via Python/pip.
- Created mkdocs.yml configuration with Material theme and Mermaid diagram support.
- Developed scripts/serve-docs.ps1 with automatic port checking (8000+).
- Added "docs:serve" command to package.json.
RESULTS:
Documentation is now served via a professional, localized web interface with searchable navigation and rendered diagrams.
EXPLANATION:
Serving documentation through a dedicated, feature-rich interface (MkDocs) ensures that technical knowledge is accessible and navigable. The automatic port checking script further enhances the developer experience by preventing common infrastructure conflicts.

--------------------------------------------------

ID: task-14-mermaid-fix
STATUS: COMPLETED (CURRENT)
COMMIT: 95eca18
DESCRIPTION: Technical refinement for Mermaid diagram stability.
CHANGES:
- Standardized all diagrams to graph TD (Top-Down) for maximum layout reliability.
- Simplified node labels (e.g., TTask[] -> TTask Array) to avoid parser conflicts.
- Ensured 100% quoting of labels containing functional characters (colons, slashes).
- Verified syntax across ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN, and SRS documents.
RESULTS:
Documentation diagrams are now fully renderable in the Material MkDocs theme without raw code artifacts.
EXPLANATION:
MkDocs/Material processing of Mermaid diagrams can be sensitive to specific character combinations like brackets and certain line-break syntax. Moving to a standardized, quoted, and Top-Down approach ensures that the technical maps remain visual and accessible across all documentation pages.
