STATUS: COMPLETED
COMMIT: 91c07ca
DESCRIPTION: Implementation of data persistence.
CHANGES:
- Upgraded useTasks hook to implement localStorage.
- Auto-hydration on load.
- Auto-save on state change.
EXPLANATION:
Storage logic was added to bridge the gap between sessions. We chose localStorage for simplicity as it fits the "System Zero" requirement for client-side containment without needing a backend yet.
